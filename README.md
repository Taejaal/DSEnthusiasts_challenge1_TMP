‚ú® Key Insights & Findings
Our exploratory analysis of the OmniMart retail dataset revealed several key patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency. These insights can help guide business decisions across marketing, logistics, and inventory planning.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Customer Behavior

1Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Concentration
The top 20% of customers account for nearly 60% of total sales, indicating that a small group of high-value customers drive the majority of revenue. This emphasizes the need for loyalty programs to retain them.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Young Customer Base
Most customers fall within the 18‚Äì25 age group, with only a few outliers in older age brackets. OmniMart's current customer base is predominantly young and digitally active.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Moderate Purchase Frequency
A majority of customers made between 2 to 10 purchases. While this shows engagement, there's room to improve repeat purchase rates through better re-targeting or rewards.

üì¶ Product & Category Insights

4Ô∏è‚É£ Category Satisfaction Gap
Electronics consistently receive lower customer ratings compared to fashion, groceries, and home products. This may point to quality issues or post-sale service concerns.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Spending Behavior by Category
Customers tend to spend more per transaction on electronics and home appliances, while groceries have high purchase frequency but lower average order value.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Brand Loyalty Patterns
A small set of leading brands dominate customer purchases, reflecting strong brand trust. Lesser-known brands face low visibility and may benefit from placement strategies or bundled offers.

üöö Operational & Sales Trends

7Ô∏è‚É£ Shipping & Cancellations
Orders with Standard Shipping have the highest cancellation rates, possibly due to delivery delays or logistical inefficiencies. This can hurt customer trust if not addressed.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonal Demand Peaks
Sales volumes spike noticeably during festive and holiday periods, underlining the need for early inventory planning and well-timed marketing campaigns.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Store Performance Variation
Some stores consistently outperform others in both sales and purchase frequency. These differences may be due to location, service quality, or local promotions.

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Ratings Skew Low to Mid
A large number of reviews fall between 2 and 3.5 stars, suggesting either moderate satisfaction or a customer base that tends to be more critical.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Distribution is Right-Skewed
The distribution of total amount spent is heavily right-skewed. A few customers contribute significantly more than the average ‚Äî again highlighting the value of retaining top spenders.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Yearly Trends Show Decline
Most sales are from 2023, followed by a sharp decline in 2024. This could indicate business slowdown, external disruptions, or missing marketing opportunities.
